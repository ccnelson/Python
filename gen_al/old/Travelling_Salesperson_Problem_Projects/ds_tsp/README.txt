ds_tsp pushes the previous tps gen alg idea by introducing
numpy arrays. These are quicker than the standard distance
check because of vectorisation.
The next idea was to switch all lists for dictionaries for
more speed. But the only remaining list is the population
which is a list of objects.... maybe a dictionary of
objects?
